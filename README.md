### Intro:
### A Legacy of Speed, Innovation, and Education


Welcome to the official repository of Kivotos Railways, the premier transportation network of Kivotos, In partnership with Highlander Railroad Academy.
More than just a railway company, Kivotos Railways serves as both the beating heart of inter-city travel and a training ground for the next generation of railway engineers, conductors, and operators.


As Kivotos Railways expanded its operations, it established it's own Freight Division to support the growing need of logistical efficiency for development.
